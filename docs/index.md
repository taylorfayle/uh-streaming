# Welcome to UH Streaming Video User Guide

With the increasing use of instructional videos created by faculty, a practical question we often get asked is what is the best hosting platform for streaming video. "Streaming" means that the video can viewed without the need to download the video file to a local drive.

Unfortunately, the answer depends on what is most important to you. If you want a platform, say, that is open to the web, easy to use, and highly adaptive to different devices, then Youtube is your best bet. If, on the other hand, your priority is securing your content by restricting access to it from UH Blackboard, then our homegrown CASA Cloud platform is your best solution. Or, you may want something that is built into the software you are using, like Snagit or Screencast-O-Matic, in which case you'd want to go with Screencast.com or Screencast-O-Matic.com. The good news is that there are a lot of solutions out there that provide user-friendly and reliable access to your video content. Below I have compiled a list of video platforms that we see faculty using successfully.
